    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a classic Italian potato salad that can be found on tables from the 
        north to the south. Meaning "parsley potatoes", you'll find Patate Prezzemolate 
        everywhere in Italy: formal luncheons, family get-togethers, weeknight dinners, 
        and even in school cafeterias. Buon appetito!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>25 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed</li>
        <li>2 green onions (white part only), chopped</li>
        <li>Â½ cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. 
            Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size. 
            Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine vinegar 
            together in a small bowl. Add garlic and set aside.</li>
        <li>Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, 
            green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. 
            Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break the 
            potatoes.</li>
        <li>Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right before serving.</li>
    </ol>
